1. Introduction
---------------

The python scripts included in this package can be used
to compute the oscillation probability of photons into 
axion-like particles in different settings of the ambient
magnetic field.

If you use any of the packages, please give a reference to the 
following papers:

- Horns et al., 2012, Physical Review D, vol. 86, Issue 7
- Meyer et al., 2013, Physical Review D, vol. 87, Issue 3, id. 035027

2. Prerequisites
----------------

The scripts require further packages written available at https://github.com/me-manu/
namely the packages eblstud, gmf, and a running version of the modified
NE2001 code (Cordes & Lazio, 2001), also available at the above repository.
The latter two packages are only required for conversion calculations in the Galactic
magnetic field of the Milky Way.
Download the packages and the add the paths to your PYTHONPATH variable.

You will also need the following python packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- kapteyn
